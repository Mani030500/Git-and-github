What is Git?
Git is a tool. It's a version control system. That just means:

It helps you track changes in your code or files.

You can go back in time to earlier versions if something breaks.

You can work with others without overwriting each other's work.

Think of Git like a save system for your project, kind of like checkpoints in a video game
